    <h2>Where is my supervisor?</h2>

    <section>

        <h3> This is your second week as a trainee in a posh downtown restaurant in Manchester. Everything is going
            well, you like the owner who is kind to you, as well as your new colleagues. For the duration of your
            traineeship, you are attached to a supervisor - a nice young woman named Rose.
            She is one of the four waitresses in the restaurant. Since you are here to help her, Rose manages 7 tables
            with guests. Each of the other waitresses manages 5 tables. </h3>
        <h3> However, some problems are waiting for you and it seems that it will not be an easy day.</h3>

                    <h3>When you come to work Monday noon, everything looks as usual. However, Rose does not turn
                        up for her shift. She does not answer her work mobile. You do not have her private mobile
                        number. Things get even worse, as there are more clients than usual and you can hardly manage
                        their orders. The other waitresses probably cannot help, as they seem to be barely managing
                        servicing their own tables. </h3>

                        waitress is not here or that they may choose to come another day. I will make an extra
                        effort to encourage them to visit again, though.</p>

                        could each take responsibility for an additional table in the restaurant. This way I'll only
                        need to manage 4 tables myself.</p>
